class Pet = 
constructor (animal, color){
This is calling the Person constructor and we pass to it what the person contructor needed. 

	this.legs = 4;
	this.eyes = 2;
	this.color = color;
	this.animal = animal;
	this.sound = sound;

	petSound(sound){
	console.log(this.)
	}
}



class Car =
constructor (make, type)
	this.tires = 4;
	this.manual = "Yes"

We are creating a new seperate class
that inherits all the properties and methods
from the Person Class



class SuperHero extends Person {

fly()
jump()
super.jump();
this.fly();
}
