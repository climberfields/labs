classes are basically a blueprint for an object
they allow us to make multiple instances of an object

for example in a game. you may have 100 enemies. 
they all are relatively the same. 

Create an enemy class that is blueprint for all enemies

defining a class
creating the blueprint
always with a capital letter
Constructor method is always called Constructor
it is called by Javascript when you instatie the new class


class Person {
constructor(){
	this.legs=2
	this.arms=2
	this.eyes='blue'
}
greet(otherperson)	
}

Initiaing a class
Creating an object from our blueprint


Can edit properties on the fly
instance is only an object
const bob = new Person();
const joan = new Person();

console.log(bob)

console.log(joan)

const Pet= 

{ 
fur = brindle
type = Pitbull
bark= load

walk (){
	console log.("MOVE Wally!)
}	
}


Pet example

class Pet = 
constructor (animal, color){
	this.legs = 4;
	this.eyes = 2;
	this.color = color;
	this.animal = animal;
	this.sound = sound;

	petSound(sound){
	console.log(this.)
	} 
}
